# React Formik

### Simple form with 3 fields
Created simple HTML form with 3 fields. 
### useFormik Hook
Install `npm add formik` library to use `useFormik` hook to connect the form to React.

### Managing form `state`
To handle form `state` we need to use `initialValues` object + `formik.handleChange` helper method provided by Formik.

###  Handling form submission
To handle form submission we need to use `onSubmit` method + `formik.handleSubmit` helper method provided by Formik
### Form validations
Validate function returns the object contains error messages for all the Form fields.
We have alternate way to specify the validation rules using `validationSchema` object using `YUP (npm add yup) library`.
Once we have the error rules we can display them using `formik.errors` and `formik.touched` objects by accessing each individual fields.  


### Formik Components - 
We can develope the form using Formik Components which gives predefiend tags can use

1.  Formik : It works as a Context Provider
2.  Form : It takes cares of regualr <form> tag
3.  Field : It takes cares of <input> fields
4.  ErrorMessage : It takes cares of validations. 













# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
